<img width="630" alt="Screenshot 2023-12-20 at 2 29 37â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/subhamku2020/SDOL/assets/71179793/f397d2a9-31c2-429e-9f72-7a90791355e0">

1. **Plan** - Requirement analysis, planning, designing, necessary training, Threat Modeling
2. **Develop** - Development, secure coding, implementing security across build & pipelines
3. **Test** - Testing , verification of security control in product & other functionality tested as well
4. **Pre-release** -  This phase incorporates services such as Security Validation and development staging activities. It may also include (as needed) end-to-end integration testing (on pre-prod system), stress testing (incl. backup & disaster recovery tests, performance tests related to security) 
5. **Release** - code signing, deployment, customer documentation etc.
6. **Prevent** - prevent attack using firewall, security configuration, cloud configuration, signature verification, Defence in depth strategy
7. **Detect** - Detection represents activities / services that may detect issues in production: Pentesting, SIEM alerts & threat intelligence, security incidents raised by customers or external researchers 
8. **Respond** - Taking necessary action on an incident . Respond phase / state also incorporates recovery activities (due to pronounced disaster or less critical, i.e., recovery due to temporary outage).
9. **Adapt** - Incidents are investigated and incorporated into a development plan to learn and adapt across organizations.
10. **Monitor** - Logging and monitoring is continuous throughout Secure SDOL (security and performance logs), applicable not only to production systems but also on dev and test systems.
                As part of governance monitoring (compliance), the compliance must be maintained throughout to ensure smooth release cycle and audits (internal or external).
