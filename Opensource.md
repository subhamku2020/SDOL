1. One of the major part of software development today is Open source software components. This also a part of Planning phase & testing phase. In Planning phase, we figure out the usage of OSS components & thier maintaince strategy. In testing phase we check if the component used have any known vulnerabilities.
2. So what is Open source component - "Open source components" refers to software components or modules whose source code is made available to the public. In open source projects, the source code is typically released under a license that allows users to view, modify, and distribute the code freely. This promotes collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development.
3. Example -  Apache HTTP server is an Open source component licensed under Apache and made freely available to community. The community helps improve the same to fix any bugs & improve performance.
4. Benefit of using Open source -

    1. Cost-Effective: Open source software is usually free to use, reducing development costs.

    2. Community Support: A large community of developers often supports open source projects. This can provide valuable resources, including documentation, forums, and user contributions.

    3. Customization: Developers can modify the source code to suit their specific needs, enabling customization and flexibility.

    4. Security: The open nature of the source code allows the community to identify and address security vulnerabilities quickly.

    5. Innovation: Open source projects often encourage innovation and collaboration, leading to rapid development and improvement of software

**Security Requirement**
1. Since Open source software source code is publicly available, the transparency also means potential vulnerabilities are exposed. This can cause a potential impact on the parent application where the open source are part of deployement.
2. Choosing a component is imporatnt. Here few things to keep in mind as Licensing (Common open-source licenses include MIT, Apache, GPL, and BSD), community support ( A vibrant community often means better support, frequent updates, and a wealth of resources), Security and Maintenance (versioning & updates), performance (Rating & no of download, reviews ), documentation. These parameter helps to identify & choose a OSS component.
3. Now after choosing a OSS, it is mandatory to create strategy to update is regularly and fix or upgrade if there is any known vulenrability in market. In todays world the dependency on open source is huge and so 60% or more of a software is developed  using open source component. To track the issues, updates, version is a big task in many corporate. So tackle these there are software/tools available which scan the list of open source use in a product to fins out outdate & vulnerable components.
4. These tools take the version of the OSS and check against Common Vulenetabilities & Exposure (CVE - It is a system for identifying, naming, and tracking vulnerabilities in software and hardware systems) Database.
